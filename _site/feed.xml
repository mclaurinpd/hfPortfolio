So the hurricane threw a wrench in my plans. I’m not complaining. Thanks for letting me stay with you for almost two weeks! I’m feeling pretty sick today, but I want to finish this before we leave so that I can give it to you on your birthday. Fortunately, working while sick really isn’t that bad. I’ve made some great progress today too. I also feel kinda bad because you facetimed me and you seemed a little disappointed because I wasn’t paying attention. Whoops. Anyway, hopefully this makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re reading this, that means that everything went smoothly. I decided, today, that I would make it so that this site would deploy on your birthday, while we are on our trip! I’m writing this on September 8th and it’s been a rather uneventful Saturday for me. It’s just past 6pm and I’ve been working pretty hard on the blog part of this site. Clearly, I’ve gotten it working, so… yay! These blog posts are my way of copying your six-month gift to me. lol. I know I haven’t been responding to your texts super quickly today, and I’m sorry, but I’ve really been focused on building this site for you and I don’t know when I will get more time to work on it. I wanted to get as much done as possible today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you something funny that happened this week! I decided that my birthday gift to you would be a website and decided to text Alex about designing you a logo. This happened at work. Funnily enough, you brought a logo that night on FaceTime and how you’d want Alex to design a logo for you. Since I’m sly, I prodded you a little bit and got the info I needed to bring to Alex. Goats. I will talk to him at church tomorrow and see what he can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Happy Birthday! If you’re reading this, that means that everything went smoothly.
