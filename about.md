Hi! My name is Hannah Fell and I am the associate editor at Chiropractic Economics and MASSAGE Magazine in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.
I am proficient in writing, editing, copyediting, proofreading, interviewing, managing writers, website content management, SEO content writing, video editing, and podcast development.
In my free time I enjoy reading, writing, running, and playing with goats.
