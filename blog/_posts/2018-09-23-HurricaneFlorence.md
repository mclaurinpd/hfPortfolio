Happy birthday again! So the hurricane threw a wrench in my plans. I'm not complaining. Thanks for letting me stay with you for almost two weeks! I'm feeling pretty sick today, but I want to finish this before we leave so that I can give it to you on your birthday. Fortunately, working while sick really isn't that bad. I've made some great progress today too. I also feel kinda bad because you facetimed me and you seemed a little disappointed because I wasn't paying attention. Whoops. Anyway, hopefully this makes up for it.

Love you.
