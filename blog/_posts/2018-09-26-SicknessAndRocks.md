So I'm watching baseball right now. The Braves are losing and you are working on some things with pet rocks. I'm honestly impressed with how cool those images turned out. You've also spent way more than an hour on them. Lol.

In other news, I managed to get your site up and running on the **actual internet.** So if you're reading this and I don't know about it I'll be a little salty.

Love you.
